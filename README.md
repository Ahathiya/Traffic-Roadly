----- OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT ------
  
 => This project proposes a real-time voice-assisted traffic sign identification system that can aid drivers in understanding and obeying traffic signs.The system consists of two subsystems, the first of which utilizes a trained convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect and recognize traffic signs. 
  
 => The CNN model is created using deep learning methods and trained on a benchmark dataset to ensure real-time detection and recognition.Once the CNN model identifies a specific traffic sign, the second subsystem uses a text-to-speech engine to narrate the sign to the driver as an audio message. 
  
 => This ensures that even if the driver misses, ignores or has difficulty understanding the traffic sign, the system can still provide the necessary information to   ensure safety on the road.

---- PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT ----- 
  => The purpose of this project is to develop a real-time voice-assisted traffic sign identification system that can accurately detect and recognize traffic signs and   provide voice alerts to drivers in real-time. 
  => The system aims to improve road safety by helping drivers, especially those driving in unfamiliar locations or those with visual impairments, to better understand and obey traffic signs. 
  => The proposed system has significant advantages, particularly for the advancement of driverless vehicles, as it can contribute to the 10
development of a robust traffic sign detection system. 
  => Overall, the project presents a novel approach to traffic sign detection and recognition, and has the potential to significantly improve road safety.
